        Computer Engineering Technology, something I'd been passionate about for a while. But it wasn't just about academics - 
        it was a whole new way of life. Moving away from home for the first time was both thrilling and terrifying. I remember 
        feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness as I set out on this journey towards independence. Despite the uncertainties, 
        I was eager to dive in, fueled by a strong sense of purpose and a hunger for growth, both personally and academically.`

        cardDetailedText: `College hit me hard. Everything was so different - the place, the people, being six hours away from home. 
        It was the first time I'd been away from my family, and I felt lost without their guidance. Sure, the freedom was nice at first. 
        I finally had time for hobbies I'd always wanted to try. But I couldn't find a balance. And before I knew it, my grades were slipping. 
        I was too proud to ask for help. I thought it meant I was weak. It's funny how those beliefs stick with you from childhood. 
        As the semesters went by, things only got worse. I felt like I was drowning in depression along with my grades.`

        cardDetailedText: `
        During the challenging times of the COVID pandemic, I struggled to land an internship or co-op opportunity due to my grades 
        slipping. It was a tough blow, and I knew I needed to turn things around. Feeling like I was falling short in various aspects 
        of my life, I hit a low point. I was overweight, barely scraping by with a 2.0 GPA each term, and couldn't see a clear 
        path forward. That's when I realized I needed a big change. Feeling a sense of urgency, I decided to visit an army recruiter. 
        The idea of joining the military appealed to me because it offered a chance to accomplish something significant, something that 
        few people get to do.`

        cardDetailedText: `After completing basic training and AIT in the army, I came back to RIT with a whole new outlook on life. 
        I was fired up with a sense of purpose like never before. Determined to make the most of my time, I hit the books hard and hit 
        the gym even harder. The army helped me shed over 20 pounds, and I adopted healthier habits along the way. This shift in focus 
        and lifestyle wasn't just about grades; it was about reclaiming control and proving to myself what I was capable of. And you know 
        what? It paid off. I not only improved my grades enough to make it onto the dean's list, but I also walked away with my degree in 
        Computer Engineering Technology, a testament to my grit and determination.`

        cardDetailedText: `
        After graduation, I got a surprise - a notice that I was being deployed with the army to Europe for a year. It was a big shift from my 
        engineering plans, but duty called. While I was there, I met so many different people and experienced new cultures. It wasn't about 
        technical stuff; it was about learning how to communicate better, work in teams, lead when needed, and live by the army's values. 
        Even though I had to press pause on my engineering dreams, this year overseas gave me a whole new perspective on life.`

        cardDetailedText: `
        Returning home after a year away was a big adjustment, especially since my engineering skills had grown a bit rusty during my time away.
         But instead of letting that discourage me, I saw it as a chance to reignite my passion for technology. I threw myself into projects and 
         learning opportunities, from tinkering with FPGA hardware to diving into full-stack web development and cybersecurity courses. 
         Then, just when I was gaining momentum, the 2024 layoffs hit the tech industry hard. It was tough, and it felt like the odds were 
         stacked against me in finding a job I loved. But through it all, I've learned the importance of perseverance. No matter the challenges, 
         I'm committed to keep trying and improving because I know that's how I'll eventually find my place in the field I'm passionate about.`
